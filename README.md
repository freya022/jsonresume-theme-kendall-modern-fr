# jsonresume-theme-kendall-modern-fr

A fork of the `kendall` theme for JSONResume, with French localization for my needs, may not cover the entirety of the template.

A theme for the [JSONResume](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema) schema, that relies on Bootstrap and FontAwesome, and slightly modified from the superb, original JSONResume theme ["Kendall"](https://github.com/LinuxBozo/jsonresume-theme-kendall).

I have made two large changes to the "Kendall" theme:
1. Removal of the profile picture
2. Improvement of the `projects` section
3. Changed colors to be more "dark mode"

You can view my resume, which uses this theme, here: [danielherink.com](https://danielherink.com).

**NOTE**: This supports schema 1.0.0.

## Typical Work-Flow

### Install `resumed`

To first use this theme, you will need to install the [`resumed` CLI tool](https://github.com/rbardini/resumed). This is an alternative to the official [JSONResume CLI tool](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-cli) that is a more modern implementation of the original tool. I prefer it to the JSONResume CLI tool.

Install `resumed` and this theme with:

```
npm install resumed jsonresume-theme-kendall-herink
```

### Put Together Your JSON Resume

In order to generate an HTML page of your JSON resume, you will of course need your resume info plugged into the proper schema. Refer to the [JSONResume](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema) repo for more information. You can also call (this assumes that `resumed` is installed in a local location):

```
/path/to/resumed/bin/resume.js init my-resume.json
```

This will create a JSON resume named "my-resume.json" with a number of fields filled out with generic information. You can use this to replace those default JSON values with your own resume details.

### Use Theme with `resumed` to Generate HTML

The handy feature of `resumed` is that when you install it with a theme, it will always default to that theme. All that is required is to call:

```
/path/to/resumed/bin/resume.js render my-resume.json -o my-resume.html
```

This will take your filled-in "my-resume.json" and create the HTML form of the resume named "my-resume.html", using this theme (assuming you installed `resumed` as detailed above).

Refer to `resumed` for the full documentation on its usage.

### Bonus: Render PDF from HTML

After creating or updating your JSON resume and generating the HTML page from it, the next step is to get a PDF of your resume. For this last step, I use Docker (or [podman](https://github.com/containers/podman), if you're familiar with it) to use a headless Chrome browser to print the HTML page to a PDF file.

To generate a slick-looking PDF, with no margins, and limited to one page, I use the docker call:

```
docker run -v "/path/to/jsomeresume/folder:/workspace" pink33n/html-to-pdf --url http://localhost/my-resume.html --pdf my-resume.pdf --no-margins --page-ranges 1
```

This will create a PDF version of your resume named "my-resume.pdf" in the same folder as the "my-resume.html" file. You can drop the `--page-ranges 1` in order to allow for multiple pages for your resume PDF.

Refer to the [pink33n/docker-html-to-pdf](https://github.com/pinkeen/docker-html-to-pdf) for full documentation.

## Why the Changes?

Alhtough I made the two changes mentioned at the top, I believe my changes maintain the elegance of the original theme. The reasons I wanted to make my changes are:

1. Removal of the profile picture

   Since I work in the U.S., I don't have a need for including a picture with my resume. I understand this is required in Europe, but isn't in the U.S. so I wanted to remove it. Removing the profile picture required changing some of the CSS so that the resulting HTML page looked good again.
2. Improving the `projects` section

   Although the original "Kendall" theme is sublime, I wanted to have a more detailed section for my project(s). I changed the `projects` section to resemble the `work` section in both the JavaScript and Mustache portions of the theme.
3. Changed the colors

   I also wanted to modify the colors so they were more "dark theme" and I went with greener colors over the blue colors found in the original theme
